        <h2>White effects</h2>
        <p>White effects are triggered when exposed to white. White is also an achromatic color, a color without a tint.
            It is one of the most common colors and is universally associated with kindness and safety. We can even argue that it has to do with how we evolved and were more active during the daytime.
            White products and designs give the impression of a clean, simple and modern design. It is the color of minimalist aesthetics, perfection, purity, neutrality.

        <h2>Black Effects</h2>
        
        <p>Black effects are triggered by black. The more users are exposed to the color, the stronger the effect will be. Black is an achromatic color, a color without a tint.
            
            Black items such as clothing, appliances and cars are perceived as chic, timeless, strong and powerful. Black has the ability to enhance confidence in appearance.
            
            In Asian cultures such as Chinese and Japanese, the symbol for black can also mean darkness or evil. Remember, context is very important in deciding when to use black or any other color!

    <section class="final"><h2>Final thoughts.There must be a balance.</h2>    
        <p> Be careful not to overuse white in your designs. Use contrasting color sparingly throughout your user interface and create the balance your users want
        We need to use both colors carefully and with context. It is important to create balanced designs that use black and white to convey the intended message clearly.
        You can also use white to create the illusion of more space, even if the physical space is the same. We perceive white objects as larger than they actually are.</p>
